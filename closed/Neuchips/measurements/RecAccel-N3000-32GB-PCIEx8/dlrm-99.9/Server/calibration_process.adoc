# **NEUCHIPS MLPerf Quantization**
NEUCHIPS adopts dynamic-range symmetric quantization to quantize weights, activations and embeddings from FP32 to int8/uint8`.

## **Weights**
NEUCHIPS adopts layer-wise quantization for MLP weights and table-wise quantization for Embedding weights`.

* Step1: find Min/Max of weights for each layer/table`.
* Step2: find the scaling factor S, which S is maximum(Min/-128, Max/127)`.
* Step3: quantize weights to int8 by S`.

## **Activations**
NEUCHIPS adopts layer-wise quantization for activations`.

* Step1: find Min/Max of activations for each layer`.
* Step2: find the scaling factor S, which S is maximum(Min\*M/-128, Max\*M/127)`. M is a hyperparameter in the range [0.8, 1.0]`.
* Step3: compute all results of calibration set for each M, and find the best M so that the scaling factor S is decided`.
* Step4: quantize activations to uint8 by S if there is an activation function`.
        otherwise, quantize activations to int8 by S`.
        the numbers that are larger than 127 or less than -128 are saturated`.
